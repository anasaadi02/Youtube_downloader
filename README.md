## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Internet connection
- Windows, macOS, or Linux

## Dependencies

- `streamlit` - Web interface framework
- `yt-dlp` - YouTube video downloader
- `pathlib` - Cross-platform path handling (built-in)
- `os` - Operating system interface (built-in)

## How it works

The script uses yt-dlp with the following optimized settings:
- `format: "bestvideo+bestaudio/best"` - Downloads the best available video and audio, then merges them
- `merge_output_format: "mp4"` - Outputs in MP4 format
- `outtmpl` - Saves files with the video title as filename in the Downloads folder

## Troubleshooting

- **"Please enter a valid YouTube URL"**: Make sure you're using a complete YouTube URL (e.g., `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...`)
- **Download failed**: Check your internet connection and try again. Some videos may be restricted or unavailable
- **File not found**: The video was downloaded but the filename might be slightly different due to special characters
